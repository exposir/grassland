<pre><code>Discovered by Yeting Li, c/o Colin Ife via Snyk.io.
<p>A ReDos (Regular Expression Denial of Service) vulnerability
was responsibly disclosed to me via email by Colin on
Mar 5 2021 regarding an exponential time complexity for
linearly increasing input lengths for <code>hwb()</code> color strings.</p>
<p>Strings reaching more than 5000 characters would see several
milliseconds of processing time; strings reaching more than
50,000 characters began seeing 1500ms (1.5s) of processing time.</p>
<p>The cause was due to a the regular expression that parses
hwb() strings - specifically, the hue value - where
the integer portion of the hue value used a 0-or-more quantifier
shortly thereafter followed by a 1-or-more quantifier.</p>
<p>This caused excessive backtracking and a cartesian scan,
resulting in exponential time complexity given a linear
increase in input length.</p>
<p>Thank you Yeting Li and Colin Ife for bringing this to my
attention in a secure, responsible and professional manner.</p>
<p>A CVE will not be assigned for this vulnerability.
