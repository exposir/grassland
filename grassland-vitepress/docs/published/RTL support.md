## Feature request

Translating to some middle eastern languages such as Hebrew, Arabic, Farsi (Persian), etc. won't change the design according to their reverse display requirements.

#### What problem does this feature solve?

RTL languages have some unique features and relevant HTML tags so these can appear correctly on screen, usually are talking about completely mirroring the interface and then make all sorts of small fixes to the over reversed elements.

#### What does the proposed API look like?

Adding a tag to select that this is an RTL language or deduce it from the language code.

#### How should this be implemented in your opinion?

It requires some CSS tinkering, preferably with CSS vars, this way it's easier to switch the entire interface in a click without refreshing.

#### Are you willing to work on this yourself?

I will try, my knowledge in frontend development is somewhat non-existant or otherwise irrelevant.
